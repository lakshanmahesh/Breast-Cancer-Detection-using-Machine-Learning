# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on detecting Breast Cancer using various machine learning algorithms.   The goal is to build an accurate classification model that can predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on cell features.

## 📊 Dataset
dataset link --> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roustekbio/breast-cancer-csv

The dataset includes medical cell features such as:
- Clump Thickness  
- Uniformity of Cell Size  
- Uniformity of Cell Shape  
- Marginal Adhesion  
- Epithelial Cell Size  
- Bare Nuclei  
- Bland Chromatin  
- Normal Nucleoli  
- Mitoses  
- Class (Target Variable)

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing
1. **Feature Scaling**  
   - Standardized features using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.

2. **Handling Imbalanced Data**  
   - Used `SMOTEENN` (from `imblearn.combine`) to balance the dataset
     
         from imblearn.combine import SMOTEENN
     
   - Visualized data distribution before and after balancing.

## 🤖 Model Training
Applied multiple machine learning models and evaluated them using **cross-validation**.

| Model                      | Accuracy         |
|:---------------------------|:----------------:|
| K-Nearest Neighbors        | 0.9988   ✅      | 
| Random Forest              | 0.9964           |
| Naive Bayes                | 0.9807           |
| Logistic Regression        | 0.9976           |
| Support Vector Machine     | 0.9976           |
